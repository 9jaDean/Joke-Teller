So, i got the idea from virtual assistants like siri and Cortana that will tell me a joke out loud if I ask them to.
I want to be able to accomplish this using JavaScript and that's what I will do with this project. So how I will do this is I will call a joke API to get a random joke.
Then I'll passed that to a text to speech API and it will tell me that joke.
I got the animated robot from giphy.com
